# About

The Love The Args project is a collaboration between Professor Sarra Lev and Michael Sokolovsky. Sarra is the Chair of the Department of Rabbinic Civilization and Associate Professor of Rabbinic Literature at Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. Michael is software engineer and co-host of the Queer Talmud comedy podcast, "Xai, How Are You?" Their shared goal of making the logic of Talmud more accesible drives the development of Love The Args, now being beta-tested by graduate rabbinical students at Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, PA. More updates coming soon, including instructional videos covering functionality and Talmudic logic.
